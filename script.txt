Planning
========
What do we want to build (Hangman)
Decompose problem
    - source control solution
    - CI solution
    - Beginning a game of Hangman :
        - Input into the game a Word.

    - Ability to win Hangman :
        - Able to guess letter(s)
        - After each guess, the ability to see if we've won
        - Winning means that we've guessed every letter of the input phrase

    - Ability to lose Hangman :
        - If we have guessed a letter that doesn't exist in the phrase 5 times,
          and have not yet won...  we have lost

    - Enable multi-word inputs into the game
    - Double guessing a character should not count against the player
